### Step 1 - Learn Sauna Basics

Learn about the basics of sauna, including what is is and what it is not, from different sources around the world. A deep source of crowd-sourced sauna information is [r/Sauna](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/new/).

### Step 2 - Try Out a Sauna Where you Live

Test out a sauna at a local gym or sauna facility in your area to get a feel for what Sauna is like. For example, in South Lake Tahoe, several gyms such [Blue Granite Climbing Gym](https://bluegraniteclimbing.com/) and [Athletx](https://www.athletex.club/) have saunas. In Sacramento, [Asha Urban Baths](https://ashaurbanbaths.com/) is an example of a dedicated sauna/spa facility.

### Step 3 - Sauna Etiquette

Once you are exposed to a sauna, learn sauna etiquette so you can enjoy sauna with others in a respectful and enjoyable manner. For example, refrain from playing loud music in public saunas and respect others desire for solitude.

### Step 4 - Sauna Techniques

Learn sauna techniques to increase health benefits and enjoyment. Many factors - such as temperature, duration, air flow, steam, ergonomics, and movement - will impact the health benefits you accrue from sauna use as well as your desire to return to the sauna into the future!

### Step 5 - Build or Purchase a Home Sauna

Once you are a sauna enthusiast, consider building or purchasing one for your backyard. Submit a request to [Tahoe Sauna Company](https://subscribepage.io/tahoesaunaco) to start the conversation to discuss options that meet your backyard sauna needs. Options range from a simple sauna kit that can be delivered to high end custom sauna builds.

### Step 6 - Customize Your Home Sauna
